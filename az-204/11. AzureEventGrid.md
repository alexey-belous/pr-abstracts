# Azure Event Grid

Event Grid - Serverless event broker.

- Events - what's happened;
- Event sources - where the event took place;
- Topics - endpoint where publisher sends events;
- Event subscription - routing events mechanism; to create the endpoint handler must be specified; 
- Event handlers - reactor on event.

No retry for:
- 400 bad request
- 413 request entity too large
- 403 forbidden

## Event schemas

Event source can publish an array of event; Array of only one element pushed then to subscriber.

```json
[
  {
    "topic": string, // full resource path to the event source
    "subject*": string, // publisher defined path to subject
    "id*": string,
    "eventType*": string, // registered event type
    "eventTime*": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

Subject path example: /A/B/C

### Cloud event schema
JSON implementation of CloudEvents v1.0 and HTTP protocol binding.

```json
{
    "specversion": "1.0",
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated",  
    "source": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-account}",
    "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e209",
    "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z",
    "subject": "blobServices/default/containers/{storage-container}/blobs/{new-file}",
    "dataschema": "#",
    "data": {
        "api": "PutBlockList",
        "clientRequestId": "4c5dd7fb-2c48-4a27-bb30-5361b5de920a",
        "requestId": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb549000000",
        "eTag": "0x8D76C39E4407333",
        "contentType": "image/png",
        "contentLength": 30699,
        "blobType": "BlockBlob",
        "url": "https://gridtesting.blob.core.windows.net/testcontainer/{new-file}",
        "sequencer": "000000000000000000000000000099240000000000c41c18",
        "storageDiagnostics": {
            "batchId": "681fe319-3006-00a8-0022-9e7cde000000"
        }
    }
}
```

## Delivery durability
No guarantee of events order. Event will be delivered at least once for each matching subscriber. If attempt to delivery fails, there will be retry according to retry policy.

### Retry policy
Customization:
- Max number of attempts
- Event TTL

```bash
az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  -g gridResourceGroup \
  --topic-name <topic_name> \
  --name <event_subscription_name> \
  --endpoint <endpoint_URL> \
  --max-delivery-attempts 18
```

### Output batching
Settings:
- Max events per batch
- Preferred batch size in kilobytes

If endpoint struggle processing events Event Grid delays sending next messages.

### Dead-letter event
Event, sent to the storage account in case if EG couldn't send an event to the endpoint.
- TTL exceed;
- Retry number exceed the limit.

## Control access
### RBAC
- Event Grid Subscription Reader - Lets you read Event Grid event subscriptions;
- Event Grid Subscription Contributor - Lets you manage Event Grid event subscription operations;
- Event Grid Contributor - Lets you create and manage Event Grid resources;
- Event Grid Data Sender - 	Lets you send events to Event Grid topics.

## Webhooks
POST HTTP request to the configured endpoint of the Webhook.

Auto-validation of ownership for:
- Azure Logic Apps via Event Grid Connector;
- Azure Automation via webhook;
- Azure Functions with Event Grid Trigger.

For other endpoints:
- Sync handshake - request from EG with `validationCode`, endpoint validates it and sends `validationCode` back.
- Async handshake - for cases when third party service is used for consuming events, and there's no possibility to send `validationCode` back. In that case should be used validation URL, that comes with validation event on the third-party service.

## Filter events
Filter by:
- Event types;
- Subjects begin or end with;
- Advanced fields and operators;

```json
// event type filtering
"filter": {
  "includedEventTypes": [
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure",
    "Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess"
  ]
}

// subject wildcard filtering
"filter": {
  "subjectBeginsWith": "/blobServices/default/containers/mycontainer/log",
  "subjectEndsWith": ".jpg"
}

// advanced filtering
"filter": {
  "advancedFilters": [
    {
      "operatorType": "NumberGreaterThanOrEquals",
      "key": "Data.Key1",
      "value": 5
    },
    {
      "operatorType": "StringContains",
      "key": "Subject",
      "values": ["container1", "container2"]
    }
  ]
}
```
